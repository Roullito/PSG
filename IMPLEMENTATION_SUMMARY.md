## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Start backend
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Start frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# 3. Visit http://localhost:5173
```

### First Steps
1. Create a season at `/seasons`
2. Create a team at `/teams`
3. Add players at `/players`
4. Create a match at `/matches`
5. Add match data (participations, metrics)
6. View analytics on dashboard

## 🔮 Ready for V2

### Architecture Decisions for Future
- **Auth**: Config placeholder for JWT (app/config.py)
- **Multi-team**: Database schema supports multiple teams
- **Scalability**: EAV pattern allows unlimited metrics without schema changes
- **API-first**: Complete OpenAPI docs for easy integration
- **Modular**: Services separated for easy extension

### Suggested V2 Enhancements
- JWT authentication + RBAC (admin/coach/player roles)
- Veo API integration for auto video parsing
- CSV/Excel export
- Advanced filtering and search
- Mobile responsive design
- Multi-language support (i18n)
- Video clip linking
- League standings
- Season comparisons

## 📊 Statistics
